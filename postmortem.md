# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## How difficult was this assignment?
	This was definiatly more difficult than the first assignment, but nothing too bad. It was a steeper learning curve to grasp all of the new CSS stuff, but it taught me a lot.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
	I have a much much better understanding of what you can do with CSS and how to use it to style the HTML elements on a webpage. 


## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?
	Centering link (CSS tricks); pseudo elements (krasimirtsonev.com); overflow link (CSS tricks) 


## How could this assignment be improved?
	Im still not sure how to get the bullets to show up as content inside my pseudo elements, so more explination on that would be nice. Thats the only tweak I would make. 


## Any other comments?
	Nope
